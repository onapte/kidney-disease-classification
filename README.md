# kidney-disease-classification

The purpose of this study is to implement a deep learning model that can classify CT scan
images of kidneys into the following four categories: normal, cyst, stone, and tumor. To
achieve this, the model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture which is
trained through transfer learning with pre-existing models to enhance the accuracy of
classification. A comparative study is conducted to evaluate the performance of different
transfer learning models, including VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50. The dataset used for
training and testing consists of over 12,000 CT images of kidneys, which are annotated by
expert radiologists. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high accuracy in
classifying kidney CT images, with an overall accuracy of 95.76%. The proposed model could
be used in clinical settings to assist radiologists in the diagnosis of kidney diseases, enhancing
the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis process.
